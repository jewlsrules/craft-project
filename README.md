# About the App
Hook and Needle is an app where makers can store their projects, inspiration, and view what other makers are up to. Users can view limited pages if they're not logged in to intice new users to sign up without giving them too much access. Once signed up, users are able to create their own project boards where they can link to patterns and yarns that they want to do.  They can also keep track of the status of their projects by marking them "to do", "current", or "done".

On individual project pages, the user will be able to see a photo or any other information about the project. If it is the user's own project, they are also able to edit the project to add, remove, or change information. If the user is looking at another users' project, they will not be able to make any changes to the project.

Users are also able to look at other users' projects on the browse page, or by looking at an individual users' page. The individual user's page will only show contact information if the user is looking at their own page, otherwise it will just list the user's projects.

Users are able to update their profile information by going to the Profile link on the nav bar. Users can log out by going to their profile page and clicking the log out button.
